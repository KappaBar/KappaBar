This project is in the early stages of starting. Here is our preliminary roadmap:

- [x] Set up project and ensure utility code is working out alright
- [ ] Add code to enumerate task lists
    - Taniko's comments: I think the object layout should be organized into program groups internally, so it's more efficient to actually implement into the taskbar.
- [ ] Begin work on classic taskbar GUI.
